      <h2 id="faq1">How do I sign up?</h2>
      <p>
        Go to our online form where you can enter your registration information.
        Remember that the registration desk is closed the night before the
        event.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq2">What is the minimum fund-raising total I have to raise?</h2>
      <p>
        There is no minimum sponsorship target. Any total will help in the
        cause. Just try and raise as much as you can.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq3">Will I receive a shirt to wear at the race?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! We will be sending out a state of the art running vest or T-shirt
        to you in the post about a month before race day. Please remember to
        specify which vest or T-shirt size you would like when confirming your
        place.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq4">When will my registration pack arrive?</h2>
      <p>
        We will mail out your registration pack in the post within two weeks of
        your registration. If you have not received the pack within that time,
        please contact us.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq5">What does it cost to register?</h2>
      <p>$35 for the 5K/10K race. The 1-Mile Fun Runs are free.</p>

      <h2 id="faq6">What happens during the race?</h2>
      <p>
        Please visit the Race Info page for all details on what to expect on
        race day.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq7">Will the race be cancelled if it rains?</h2>
      <p>
        This event will occur rain or shine. We suggest ponchos and rain gear if
        it does happen to rain. All registration fees and donations are
        non-refundable in the event of rain.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq8">Do I need to register my child?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, if your child is participating in the 5K/10K races. There is no
        need to register children for the 1 Mile Fun Run.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq9">Can I bring my pet?</h2>
      <p>
        Pets are discouraged at the race. There are over 2000 people competing
        in the race and it is too crowded to accommodate pets.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq10">Where do I park?</h2>
      <p>
        The earlier you arrive at the race site, the easier parking will be! You
        may park on the streets as long as you are not blocking driveways or
        residential streets. We encourage you to carpool with your team or other
        participants if possible.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq11">Can I collect sponsorship online?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. You can sign up at several web charity organizers and follow their
        easy step by step guide to create your own online fund-raising page. All
        money raised through your page will be automatically sent through to us
        and allocated to your record.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq12">How do I withdraw from the event?</h2>
      <p>
        The registration pack will include an official event magazine with
        withdrawal instructions. Complete the withdrawal form and send it to the
        race organizers along with the race gear and timing chip. A $10
        organizational fee will be charged to all withdrawals.
      </p>

      <h2 id="faq13">
        I am looking for accommodation for the event, where is best to stay?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are partnering with the Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce to direct
        visiting runners for places to stay. Low-cost camping is available in
        Prairie Park.
